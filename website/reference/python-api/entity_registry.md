entity_registry.py — Persistent personal entity registry for MemPalace.

Knows the difference between Riley (a person) and ever (an adverb).
Built from three sources, in priority order:
  1. Onboarding — what the user explicitly told us
  2. Learned — what we inferred from session history with high confidence
  3. Researched — what we looked up via Wikipedia for unknown words

Usage:
    from mempalace.entity_registry import EntityRegistry
    registry = EntityRegistry.load()
    result = registry.lookup("Riley", context="I went with Riley today")
    # → &#123;"type": "person", "confidence": 1.0, "source": "onboarding"}

## Classes

#### `__init__`

```python
def __init__(self, data: dict, path: Path)
```

#### `load`

```python
def load(cls, config_dir: Optional[Path] = None) -> 'EntityRegistry'
```

#### `save`

```python
def save(self)
```

#### `mode`

```python
def mode(self) -> str
```

#### `people`

```python
def people(self) -> dict
```

#### `projects`

```python
def projects(self) -> list
```

#### `ambiguous_flags`

```python
def ambiguous_flags(self) -> list
```

#### `seed`

```python
def seed(self, mode: str, people: list, projects: list, aliases: dict = None)
```

Seed the registry from onboarding data.

people: list of dicts &#123;"name": str, "relationship": str, "context": str}
projects: list of str
aliases: dict &#123;"Max": "Maxwell", ...}

#### `lookup`

```python
def lookup(self, word: str, context: str = '') -> dict
```

Look up a word. Returns entity classification.

context: surrounding sentence (used for disambiguation of ambiguous words)

Returns:
    &#123;"type": "person"|"project"|"concept"|"unknown",
     "confidence": float,
     "source": "onboarding"|"learned"|"wiki"|"inferred",
     "name": canonical name if found,
     "needs_disambiguation": bool}

#### `research`

```python
def research(self, word: str, auto_confirm: bool = False, allow_network: bool = False) -> dict
```

Research an unknown word.

By default this is **local-only**: it checks the wiki cache and
returns ``"unknown"`` for uncached words.  Pass
``allow_network=True`` to explicitly opt in to an outbound
Wikipedia lookup.  This design honours the project's
*local-first, zero API* and *privacy by architecture* principles
— no data leaves the machine unless the caller requests it.

Caches result.  If *auto_confirm* is ``False``, marks the entry
as unconfirmed (needs user review).

#### `confirm_research`

```python
def confirm_research(self, word: str, entity_type: str, relationship: str = '', context: str = 'personal')
```

Mark a researched word as confirmed and add to people registry.

#### `learn_from_text`

```python
def learn_from_text(self, text: str, min_confidence: float = 0.75, languages = ('en',)) -> list
```

Scan session text for new entity candidates.
Returns list of newly discovered candidates for review.

``languages`` is forwarded to entity detection — pass the user's
configured ``MempalaceConfig().entity_languages`` to match the
locales used at ``mempalace init`` time.

#### `extract_people_from_query`

```python
def extract_people_from_query(self, query: str) -> list
```

Extract known person names from a query string.
Returns list of canonical names found.

#### `extract_unknown_candidates`

```python
def extract_unknown_candidates(self, query: str) -> list
```

Find capitalized words in query that aren't in registry or common words.
These are candidates for Wikipedia research.

#### `summary`

```python
def summary(self) -> str
```
