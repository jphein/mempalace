# `mempalace.format_miner`

Source: [`mempalace/format_miner.py`](https://github.com/techempower-org/mempalace/blob/main/mempalace/format_miner.py)

format_miner.py — proposed for mempalace 3.3.6.

A third miner alongside ``miner.py`` (project files) and ``convo_miner.py``
(chat exports). This one handles **binary office-format documents**:
PDF, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX, RTF, EPUB.

Architecture matches the existing miner-per-content-type pattern:

    mempalace mine &lt;dir>                  → miner.py
    mempalace mine &lt;dir> --mode convos    → convo_miner.py
    mempalace mine &lt;dir> --mode extract   → format_miner.py (this file)

**Read-time conversion**, never modifies source files on disk. The user's
``~/research.pdf`` stays exactly as it was after a mine — the bytes are
read into memory, handed to Microsoft's MarkItDown library for conversion
to Markdown, and the resulting text flows into the normal chunker /
drawer-store pipeline. Conversion artifacts never touch disk.

MarkItDown is an **optional** runtime dependency (declared as an extra).
If the user runs ``mempalace mine --mode extract`` without it installed,
they get a clear ``pip install markitdown`` instruction, not a crash.

**Per-format transformer routing** (verified live on a local mixed-format
test directory, 2026-05-19): MarkItDown 0.1.5 does NOT convert .rtf —
it returns the raw RTF control-code source unchanged. So .rtf is routed
to the purpose-built ``striprtf`` library; all other formats stay on
MarkItDown.

    .pdf, .docx, .pptx, .xlsx, .epub  → MarkItDown
    .rtf                              → striprtf

Both libraries are optional runtime dependencies. If a user tries to
extract a format whose transformer isn't installed, they get a clear
install message (SKIP_NO_MARKITDOWN or SKIP_NO_STRIPRTF), not a crash.

**13 fringe cases handled** (spec finalized 2026-05-19):

    1.  MarkItDown not installed     → SKIP_NO_MARKITDOWN  (clear install msg)
    2.  File too large (> max)        → SKIP_TOO_LARGE
    3.  iCloud cloud-only file        → SKIP_CLOUD_ONLY
    4.  Encrypted PDF                 → SKIP_ENCRYPTED
    5.  Empty file                    → SKIP_EMPTY
    6.  Permission denied             → SKIP_PERMISSION
    7.  Broken symlink                → SKIP_BROKEN_SYMLINK
    8.  Dirty encoding                → recovered via decode_robust
    9.  Windows path semantics        → pathlib throughout
    10. MarkItDown internal crash     → SKIP_EXTRACTION_ERROR
    11. Network / sync timeout        → SKIP_NETWORK_TIMEOUT
    12. Unrecognized extension        → SKIP_UNRECOGNIZED
    13. striprtf not installed        → SKIP_NO_STRIPRTF    (added 2026-05-19
                                                            after live test
                                                            on local RTF files)

Deferred (out of scope): custom PDF parsers for specific document types,
OCR on scanned PDFs, DRM-locked files, pathological corrupt files.
These get reported and skipped.

## Classes

### `class ExtractionStatus(enum.Enum)`

Outcome of an ``extract_text`` call.

Test-friendly enum (each case has its own name) so callers can assert
exactly which path was taken. ``OK`` means text came back; everything
else is a skip variant.

## Functions

### `decode_robust`

```python
def decode_robust(raw: bytes) -> str
```

Decode bytes to text without raising on dirty encodings.

Strategy: UTF-8 first (the clean case). On failure, try CP1252 (handles
legacy smart-quote bytes 0x91-0x9F that surface in older Office docs).
Final fallback is UTF-8 with ``errors='replace'`` so no byte is ever
lost — only made visible as the replacement char.

### `is_icloud_dataless`

```python
def is_icloud_dataless(path: Path) -> bool
```

True if ``path`` is an iCloud cloud-only placeholder (not local).

Two indicators:
  1. The literal ``.icloud`` suffix iCloud uses for offloaded files.
  2. The macOS UF_COMPRESSED / dataless flag on the inode (``st_flags``).

Either signal means MarkItDown would block on file I/O waiting for
iCloud to materialize the bytes, which can hang for minutes. We skip
these and report.

### `extract_text`

```python
def extract_text(path: Union[Path, str], max_file_size: int = DEFAULT_MAX_FILE_SIZE) -> tuple[Optional[str], ExtractionStatus]
```

Convert ``path`` to plain text via MarkItDown, with comprehensive fringe-case handling.

Returns ``(text, ExtractionStatus)`` — text is ``None`` for every skip
case, a non-empty string for ``OK``.

Pure function (no I/O outside the file at ``path``). Source file is
never modified.

### `scan_formats`

```python
def scan_formats(directory: Union[Path, str]) -> list[Path]
```

Walk ``directory`` recursively and return supported files, sorted.

Skips:
  - Hidden / build directories listed in ``palace.SKIP_DIRS``
  - Filenames listed in ``_SKIP_FILENAMES`` (.DS_Store etc.)
  - Symlinks (prevents circular links / processing the same file via
    multiple paths; mirrors ``miner.py`` and ``convo_miner.py``)
  - Files whose suffix isn't in ``SUPPORTED_FORMATS``

Returns a list of ``Path`` objects. The order is deterministic
(sorted by path) so a re-mine processes files in the same order each
time — useful for reproducing bug reports.

### `mine_formats`

```python
def mine_formats(format_dir: str, palace_path: str, wing: Optional[str] = None, agent: str = 'mempalace', limit: int = 0, dry_run: bool = False) -> None
```

Mine a directory of binary office-format files into the palace.

Walks ``format_dir`` via ``scan_formats``, converts each supported file
to text via ``extract_text`` (which routes to MarkItDown or striprtf
per format), chunks the result with the same chunker miner.py uses, and
files the chunks as drawers under the given wing.

Source files on disk are never modified — conversion is in-memory only.

Parameters
----------
format_dir :
    Directory to walk recursively. Hidden / build dirs are skipped
    (see ``palace.SKIP_DIRS``). Symlinks are skipped (consistency with
    ``miner.py`` and ``convo_miner.py``). Only files matching
    ``SUPPORTED_FORMATS`` are processed.
palace_path :
    Path to the ChromaDB palace (the destination of the drawers).
wing :
    Wing name. Defaults to the basename of ``format_dir`` (normalized).
agent :
    Identifier recorded in each drawer's ``added_by`` metadata.
limit :
    If > 0, process at most this many files. Useful for sampling.
dry_run :
    If True, walk + extract + chunk but do NOT open the collection or
    upsert any drawers. Just prints what would have been filed.

Notes
-----
- Loads ``MempalaceConfig`` once at the start. The current chunker
  (``miner.chunk_text``) uses module-level CHUNK_SIZE constants and
  doesn't accept overrides, so the loaded config values aren't yet
  threaded into chunking; the load is wired so future ``chunk_text``
  refactors that accept per-call sizing pick this up automatically.
- Each per-file step is wrapped so one malformed file can't crash the
  whole mine; the loop continues with the next file and logs the
  offender.
- ``KeyboardInterrupt`` is caught at the orchestrator level so the
  summary still prints on Ctrl-C; partial progress is safe to leave
  in place because drawer IDs are deterministic (re-mining
  upserts to the same rows).
