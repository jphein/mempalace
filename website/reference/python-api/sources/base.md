# `mempalace.sources.base`

Source: [`mempalace/sources/base.py`](https://github.com/techempower-org/mempalace/blob/main/mempalace/sources/base.py)

Source adapter contract for MemPalace (RFC 002).

Mirrors what ``mempalace/backends/base.py`` does for the write side: it defines
the read-side surface every source adapter must implement. A source adapter
extracts content from a specific origin (filesystem, git, Slack, Cursor …) and
yields typed records (``SourceItemMetadata`` / ``DrawerRecord``) that core
routes into the palace.

This module is spec scaffolding. The first-party miners (``mempalace/miner.py``
and ``mempalace/convo_miner.py``) are migrated onto it in a follow-up PR;
in this PR we publish the contract so third-party adapters can begin building
against a stable surface.

See ``docs/rfcs/002-source-adapter-plugin-spec.md`` for the authoritative
spec text.

## Classes

### `class SourceAdapterError(Exception)`

Base class for every source-adapter error raised by core.

### `class SourceNotFoundError(SourceAdapterError)`

Raised when a ``SourceRef`` does not resolve to a readable source.

### `class AuthRequiredError(SourceAdapterError)`

Raised when an adapter needs credentials that were not provided.

The message MUST name the env vars (or other supported mechanism) the
operator needs to set.

### `class AdapterClosedError(SourceAdapterError)`

Raised when an adapter method is called after ``close()``.

### `class TransformationViolationError(SourceAdapterError)`

Raised by the conformance suite when round-tripping a drawer requires
an undeclared transformation (RFC 002 §7.2–7.3).

### `class SchemaConformanceError(SourceAdapterError)`

Raised when a ``DrawerRecord.metadata`` violates the adapter schema
returned by :meth:`BaseSourceAdapter.describe_schema`.

### `class SourceRef`

A handle to the source a user wants to ingest.

``local_path`` is for filesystem-rooted sources (project dir, mbox file).
``uri`` is for URL-like references (``github.com/org/repo``,
``slack://workspace/channel``).
``options`` carries adapter-specific non-secret config. Secrets MUST NOT
be placed here; see §4.2.

### `class RouteHint`

Adapter-supplied routing hint (RFC 002 §2.5).

### `class SourceItemMetadata`

Lightweight pointer yielded before drawers for lazy-fetch adapters.

Core inspects ``version`` via :meth:`BaseSourceAdapter.is_current` to
decide whether to skip extraction; an adapter that responds positively
stops yielding drawers for this item and moves to the next.

### `class DrawerRecord`

One drawer's worth of extracted content plus flat metadata.

``metadata`` values MUST be flat scalars (``str``/``int``/``float``/``bool``)
per RFC 001 §1.4 — the chroma constraint. Nested data belongs on the
knowledge graph (§5.5) or in a declared ``json_string`` field (§5.4).

### `class SourceSummary`

High-level description of a source returned by :meth:`source_summary`.

### `class FieldSpec`

Declared shape of a single per-adapter metadata field (§5.2).

### `class AdapterSchema`

The per-adapter metadata schema returned by :meth:`describe_schema`.

### `class BaseSourceAdapter(ABC)`

Long-lived adapter serving many ``SourceRef`` invocations (RFC 002 §2).

Instances are lightweight on construction — no I/O, no network, no
credential fetch. All work is deferred to :meth:`ingest`. Instances are
thread-safe for concurrent ``ingest`` calls across different ``SourceRef``
values (v1 serializes within a single ``SourceRef``).

Class attributes form the adapter's identity contract:

* ``name`` — stable adapter name used for registration and drawer metadata.
* ``adapter_version`` — adapter's own version, independent of
  ``spec_version``. Recorded on every drawer so re-extract workflows can
  target drawers from a known-buggy adapter version.
* ``capabilities`` — free-form tokens; core inspects a documented subset.
* ``supported_modes`` — subset of ``chunked_content``, ``whole_record``,
  ``metadata_only``.
* ``declared_transformations`` — set of transformation names the adapter
  applies to source bytes. The empty set marks a byte-preserving adapter.
* ``default_privacy_class`` — privacy class level (§6) applied unless the
  palace config overrides it.

#### `ingest`

```python
def ingest(self, *, source: SourceRef, palace: 'PalaceContext') -> Iterator[IngestResult]
```

Enumerate and extract content from a source.

Yields a stream of ``SourceItemMetadata`` and ``DrawerRecord`` values.
Lazy adapters yield ``SourceItemMetadata`` ahead of the drawers for
that item so core can check :meth:`is_current` before committing to
the fetch. Eager adapters MAY interleave freely.

#### `describe_schema`

```python
def describe_schema(self) -> AdapterSchema
```

Declare the structured metadata this adapter attaches.

The returned schema MUST be stable for a given ``adapter_version``.
Enterprises index on it; core uses it to validate adapter output.

#### `is_current`

```python
def is_current(self, *, item: SourceItemMetadata, existing_metadata: Optional[dict]) -> bool
```

Return True if the palace already has an up-to-date copy of ``item``.

Default: always returns False (re-extract every time). Adapters
advertising ``supports_incremental`` MUST override.

#### `source_summary`

```python
def source_summary(self, *, source: SourceRef) -> SourceSummary
```

Describe a source without extracting.

#### `close`

```python
def close(self) -> None
```

Release any resources the adapter holds. Default: no-op.
