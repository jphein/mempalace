Auto-query runner — chains signal extraction, routing, and formatting.

This module is the single entry point for the auto-query pipeline.
It is called from the UserPromptSubmit hook (via ``__main__.py``) or
directly from tests.

Pipeline::

    load config → check enabled/mode → extract signals → pick tool
    → execute MCP call → format injection → log decision

The MCP call is made via ``_call_mcp()``, which delegates to the
palace-daemon HTTP proxy (``/mcp`` endpoint).  When the daemon is not
reachable, the call is skipped and a dry-run decision is logged.

## Classes

### `class AutoQueryResult`

Result of a single auto-query pipeline run.

#### `__init__`

```python
def __init__(self, injection = None, decision = None, tool_call = None, mcp_result = None, receipt = None)
```

## Functions

### `run_auto_query`

```python
def run_auto_query(prompt, session_id, turn, project_wing = '', known_wings = None, known_entities = None, has_recent_drawers = False, config = None, queried_entities = None, log_dir = None, wing_counts = None)
```

Run the auto-query pipeline for a single user turn.

Returns an ``AutoQueryResult`` with the injection text (or None),
the decision record, and the raw MCP result.
