"""AGE-backed implementation of KnowledgeGraph (Apache AGE on Postgres).

Companion to `mempalace.knowledge_graph.KnowledgeGraph` (SQLite). Selectable
via `MEMPALACE_KG_BACKEND=age` once the config-routing layer is wired up.
Mirrors the public interface of the SQLite KG so callers can swap backends
without code changes.

The graph itself is `mempalace_kg` registered in AGE's `ag_catalog`. It is
created on first init and reused thereafter — initialization is idempotent.

        - ``relationship_types`` — sorted distinct ``relation_type`` values

        Tries ``_stats_fast`` first (SQL against the AGE backing label
        tables — sub-ms on ≥1M edges because Postgres serves plain
        ``count(*)`` straight off the visibility map without unwrapping
        every value through agtype). Falls back to ``_stats_cypher`` when
        the backing tables aren't available yet (fresh palace, label not
        yet created, or non-standard AGE setup). The fallback runs three
        full graph walks and is the slow path the issue measures at ~9s
        on the production palace at ~1M entities / ~1.6M RELATION edges.

        Implemented to close techempower-org/mempalace#96 (envelope
        shape) and #266 (performance — replaces the ~9s slow path with
        sub-100ms).

        Ported from palace-daemon ``f56e238`` — AGE registers each label
        as a regular Postgres table under the graph's schema
        (``mempalace_kg."Entity"``, ``mempalace_kg."RELATION"``, ...),
        so a plain ``SELECT count(*)`` hits the visibility map without
        materializing agtype-wrapped rows. Identifier case is preserved
        by AGE so the quoted-identifier names are mandatory; lowercase
        names 404.

        ``current_facts`` and ``relationship_types`` use the agtype
        ``->>`` operator to read the RELATION properties column as JSON.
        Both are wrapped in savepoints so a missing-operator error (older
        AGE without agtype ``->>`` support) only loses the savepoint, not
        the outer transaction, and we transparently fall through to a
        single Cypher walk for that one field.

        Raises on backing-table miss (e.g. label not yet created on a
        fresh palace) so the outer ``stats()`` method can fall back to
        the full-Cypher path.

        - source/valid_from/valid_to go through their respective
          sanitize_* helpers.
        - ``_inline_cypher_params`` does single-pass substitution so a
          value containing ``$other_key`` cannot trigger a recursive
          replacement.
        - ``_cypher_literal`` rejects any string containing the outer
          dollar-quote tag (``$mp_age_q$``); combined with the tagged
          envelope below, an adversarial value cannot escape into
          surrounding SQL.

        Pass ``commit=False`` for bulk write loops (see
        ``backfill_age._BulkWriter``) so the caller can batch many
