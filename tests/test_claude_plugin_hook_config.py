# Per-event hook-level timeout bounds (milliseconds): (floor, ceiling).
#
# NOTE: Claude Code's hook ``timeout`` field is documented in milliseconds
# (see Claude Code hook docs and JP's settings.json at ~/.claude/settings.json
# which uses values like 5000 / 10000 / 130000). Upstream's original bounds
# (10..30 / 60..90) were in seconds and matched their inline
# ``mempalace hook run`` subprocess invocation; the fork routes through
# ``palace-daemon/clients/hook.py`` and the timeout is interpreted by
# Claude Code in ms, so the bounds are scaled accordingly.
#
# Stop is fire-and-forget for the mine subprocess (palace-daemon detaches),
# but the daemon also handles _save_diary synchronously which touches
# postgres. 10000..30000ms is generous for that work without leaving room
# for runaway hangs to freeze the session.
#
# PreCompact runs the daemon's mine path synchronously; the 30000ms ceiling
# bounds the worst case. (Upstream uses 90000ms cap for inline subprocess
# invocation; fork's daemon path completes faster.)
#
# SessionStart is a cheap warmup ping — 5000ms is plenty.
#
# SessionEnd backgrounds all of its work in the shell wrapper — the foreground
# only forks the detached child and returns near-instantly — so its timeout is
# a generous backstop on a near-instant operation, not a synchronous-work bound
# like Stop/PreCompact. A bound is still required (#1465) so a wedged fork can
# never fall back to the 600s command default. The bash wrapper carries a small
# native-unit timeout, so its bound is in the seconds scale, not ms.
